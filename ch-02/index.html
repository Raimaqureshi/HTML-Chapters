   <i><h2>HTML basics</h2></i>
   <p>HTML is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>

   <p>The term <dfn>HTML</dfn> stands for HyperText Markup Language.</p>
   <p>The abbreviation for <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is commonly used in web development.</p><!--shows the full form on hover.-->
   
    <h3>So what is HTML?</h3> 
       <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:
<br>
       <strong>My cat is very grumpy</strong>
<br>            
        If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
<br>          
       <strong>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</p></strong>
    <em><h4>Anatomy of an HTML element</h4></em>        
        <p>The main parts of our element <s>are</s> are as follows:<br>1. The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.<br>2. The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.<br>3. The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.<br>4. The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</p>

        <h4>HTML Tags</h4>
    
    <p>The <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> tag is used for subscript text, like in H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
    <p>The <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> tag is used for superscript text, like in E = mc<sup>2</sup>.</p>

    <h5>Example</h5>
    <p>Water is represented by H<sub>2</sub>O, and Einstein's famous equation is E = mc<sup>2</sup>.</p>
        <dl>
            <b> <dt>Nesting elements</dt></b>
             <dd>You can put elements inside other <del>ements</del> <ins>elements</ins> too — this is called nesting.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h5>Void elements</h5>
             <p>Some elements have no content and are called void elements.</p>
