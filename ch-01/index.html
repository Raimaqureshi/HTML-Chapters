    <h1>HTML basics</h1>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>

    <h2>So what is HTML?</h2> 
        <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:
<br>
            My cat is very grumpy
            <br>
            If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
     <br>       
            &lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</p>
    <h2>Anatomy of an HTML element</h2>        
        <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:<br>1. The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.<br>2. The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.<br>3. The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.<br>4. The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</p>
